        "40 cm",

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The radius of curvature is twice the focal length. R = 2f = 2 Ã— 20 = 40 cm",

        "Convex mirror",
        "Cylindrical mirror"

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Concave mirrors are used in car headlights because they can focus light rays into a parallel beam",
