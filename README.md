    structure: {
        classes: [
            {
                name: "Class 10",
                subjects: [
                    {
                        name: "Physics (Board)",
                        topics: [
                            {
                                name: "Light - Reflection and Refraction",
                                papers: [
                                    {
                                        name: "Laws of Reflection - Test 1",
                                        duration: 50,  // minutes
                                        questions: 4,
                                        jsonFile: "class_10_physics_reflection_laws_test1.json"
                                    }
                                ]
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
    questions: {
        'class_10_physics_reflection_laws_test1.json': {
            paper_info: { /* exam metadata */ },
